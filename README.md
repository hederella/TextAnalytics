## Description
This is a repository housing our final project for Text Analytics. 
We will examine a dataset of job postings, using the tools we have learned in class to distinguish real from fake job listings.

## Data 
Our data comes from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction). 
It contains about 17,900 records of job postings, 800 of which were fraudulent. 
There are 3 text columns: description, requirements, and benefits.
Additionally there are 13 other columns mostly focusing on metadata of the listing, alongside a binary target variable representing whether the posting is fraudulent.
Both it and this repository are in the public domain

## Running
Our repo consists of a Jupyter notebook and two csv files of data. The notebook is self-contained, with pip commands and can be simply downloaded and run as-is.
